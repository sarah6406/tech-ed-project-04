# tech-ed-project-04


As a user, I am able to visit the render website and access the page on both laptop and phone, including use of media queries so that the form is suitable for smaller screens. I am able to add a message to the guestbook which then appends to the end of the list of messages. The form field is then cleared ready for the next user input.

I found this project a big leap in my programming journey! Had always thought I was more interested in front-end, but have discovered the back-end world through building servers and databases, and utilising APIs - I have also been able to become fairly proficient in using the terminal within VS Code, having more of an understanding of the commands used when connecting and deploying client and server side code.

I created a simple front-end as I was more interested in understanding the functionality of the server-side code. I found it a bit of a mystery to deploy the site to render, and through the logs on render I discovered that it was good practice to implement a .env file so that I could set an environment variable for suitable configuration. This was implemented with some guidance from a mentor. 

I am still learning the vocabulary of a programmer, but it was very satisfying to build a simple website as a full-stack application.
